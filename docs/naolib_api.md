# Introduction

This section is based on the [Open Data TAN (1.0.0) Swagger](https://open.tan.fr/doc/openapi).

!!! info

    TAN became Naolib in september 2023.

As the API is not fully documented, I have attempted to document it myself.

I have analyzed its behavior and responses, using my knowledge of the transport system of Nantes, the city where I live.

!!! warning

    Naolib was not involved in the making of this guide. As a consequence, the information contained in this section may not be entirely accurate.
