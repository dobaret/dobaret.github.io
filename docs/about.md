# About

As a technical writer, I'm really interested in the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) philosophy. This website follows its principles.

My process is the following:

1. I write the pages in a plain text format: <span class="do_not_break">:simple-markdown: Markdown</span>.
2. I commit changes to a <span class="do_not_break">:material-github: GitHub</span> repository.
3. When the `main` branch of the GitHub repository receives a commit, GitHub actions automatically transform the Markdown source files into HTML files.
