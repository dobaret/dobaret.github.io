I'm currently a <span class="do_not_break">:fontawesome-solid-computer: software</span> technical writer at Antidot. We make a tool called [Fluid&nbsp;Topics](https://www.fluidtopics.com/).

I maintain [docs.fluidtopics.com](https://docs.fluidtopics.com/) using the [docs-as-code](about.md) philosophy.

In my free time, I like to <span id="bikeHover" class="do_not_break">:material-bike-fast: cycle(1)</span>, do some <span class="do_not_break">:material-run-fast: running</span>, and spend time with my <span class="do_not_break">:material-cat: cat(2)</span>.

1. ![A bicycle rests on a patch of snow by the roadside, adjacent to a rocky and forested hillside. The road curves gently and is bordered by grass and patches of snow. Tall evergreen trees line the right side, with a clear blue sky overhead. A bright orange item is strapped to a saddle bag, contrasting with the natural surroundings.](./images/velo.jpg)

2. ![A tabby cat with green eyes is lying on a blue cushioned surface in a cozy living room. Behind the cat, there's a television and a bookshelf with board games like Scrabble visible. A large, leafy houseplant is positioned in the background, adding a touch of greenery to the room. The cat looks directly at the camera with a relaxed expression.](./images/cat.jpg)
